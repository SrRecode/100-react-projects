# Day 16: React Visiting Card Generator

> Project 16 of 100 · Folder: `day-16-react-visiting-card-generator`

## What it does

Design a print-proportioned visiting card.

### Included workflow

Edit contact details; select a theme; preview SVG; download or print.

### Scope and limitations

Details are saved in localStorage. Confirm bleed, trim, and color requirements with the printer.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ and npm. From this folder:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite (usually <http://localhost:5173>). To make and preview a production build:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Available scripts

- `npm run dev` — `vite`
- `npm run build` — `vite build`
- `npm run preview` — `vite preview`

## Implementation

- **Framework:** React with Vite.
- **Entry point:** `src/main.jsx` loads `src/App.jsx`.
- **Feature files:** `src/FeatureApp.jsx` and `src/feature.css`.
- **Runtime dependencies:** `react`, `react-dom`, `vite`.
- **Development dependencies:** none listed.
- **Data:** See the scope notes for this app’s storage and external-service behavior.

## Privacy and production use

This folder is an independent client-side app; it does not import runtime code from other days. Browser storage belongs to this browser profile and is not a secure vault or backup. Only grant browser permissions when you choose to use the relevant feature. Treat sample data as disposable. Before production use, implement and configure any required authentication, API, cloud storage, AI, or payment service securely.

See the [collection guide](../README.md) for the complete project index and root workspace commands.
